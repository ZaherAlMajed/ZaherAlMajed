# Zaher Al Majed
## The Man Behind the Beard

My name is Zaher Al Majed, and I'm a Bahrain-based self-taught multi-dimensional designer & coder with plenty of years of experience in creating design solutions for various platforms and media.

I also lecture & speak on professional practice in art & design and have delivered sessions on design and creativity to a wide range of audiences, from graphic design students to professionals.

I started my career with the belief that if you want to be a better designer, you need to train your eye for creativity and constantly strive to achieve perfection. You need to be constantly up-to-date about what’s new out there, be it digital solutions, market trends, ground-breaking branding ideas, etc. My biggest strengths are my consistent determination to learn more, my passion to achieve anything I set my mind to.

## Hire Me
Thank you for showing interest in me and my work! I believe that the relationship between a designer and the client should be just that, a relationship. A designer is only going to make so much work within his lifetime and this is one of the many reasons why I care about where my work lives. I want the work I create to go to great people that love and value it.
